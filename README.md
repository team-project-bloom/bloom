```
mvn -version
```

- Docker & Docker Compose
```
docker --version
docker compose version

Open the Terminal

Navigate to the Project Folder
- Use the cd command to move into the folder that contains your Spring Boot project (the folder with the pom.xml file):
```
cd path/to/your/project
```
*Example:*
```
cd ~/Documents/bloom
```

Before running the project, create .env a file in the root directory with the required credentials

*Example:*
```

JWT_SECRET=your_data 
MYSQLDB_USER=your_data
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_data
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=your_data
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=your_data
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=your_data
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=your_data
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=your_data
DEBUG_PORT=your_data
```

Run the Application Using Maven
- Use the following command to launch the Spring Boot application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Or Use Docker Compose to run app**

- Create .jar file
```
mvn clean package
```

- Run the app with Docker Compose
```
docker compose up --build
```

Verify the Application is Running
- If successful, you will see logs ending with something like:
```
