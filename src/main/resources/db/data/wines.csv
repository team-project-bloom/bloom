Old Mates Pinot Noir,30,12.5,RED,NON_ORGANIC,2024,1,1,"Floral and flirty, this Pinot Noir seriously overdelivers. From a single vineyard in Stellenbosch, it offers a mix of ripe red berries, a hint of white pepper, bright acidity, and fine tannins. Soft and juicy, it drinks beautifully both chilled and at room temperature. The wine is made by Mick & Jeanine Craven — an Australian–South African duo who met during harvest in Sonoma (USA) in 2007. After years of winemaking experience across the globe, they settled in Stellenbosch in 2011 and launched Craven Wines — a label that expresses the uniqueness of local vineyards.",False
Funkstille 'Skin Contact',26,12.5,ORANGE,VEGAN,2020,2,2,"A perfect ‘gateway’ orange wine — a gentle intro to skin contact styles.

Jauma 'Origins' Skin Contact,38,13.5,ORANGE,NATURAL,2021,4,4,"You don’t often see Arneis from South Australia — let alone as a skin-contact wine — making this a rare gem. Grown in Kuitpo (Adelaide Hills) and left on skins for two weeks, it bursts with marmalade, cooked pear, and peach, balanced by zesty acidity and a touch of tannin. James Erskine, once Sommelier of the Year and now a boundary-pushing winemaker, crafts wines with zero additions — no sulphur since 2015.

Zesty, wild, and full of personality. Cobaw Ridge, a biodynamic pioneer in the cool-climate Macedon Ranges, has been led by the Cooper family since 1985.

Made from Aleatico and Chenin Blanc, it’s light but zippy, with notes of blood orange, tomato juice, and a funky, yeasty edge. Way more exciting than your average pink drink — and still super fresh.

Sèt e Mèz Pét Nat Rosé,36,12,SPARKLING,ORGANIC,2023,9,5,"This unique Pét Nat Rosé is made from Fortana — a rare, high-acid, savoury red grape native to Emilia-Romagna. Expect bright, fruit-forward flavours of wild strawberry, raspberry, and tangy plum, with a lightly saline, vermouth-like spice and amaro bitterness. Sèt e Mèz is true farmer fizz — approachable, quirky, and dangerously drinkable. Mirco Mariotti grows his grapes just 300m from the Adriatic Sea in eastern Romagna, where vines are over 100 years old and shaped by salty winds.

Old Mates Rosé,29,12,ROSE,VEGAN,2024,3,1,"This Syrah-based rosé is full of personality — spicy, complex, and seriously drinkable. With notes of pink grapefruit, dried peach, and cinnamon, plus zippy acidity, it’s just as suited to dinner as it is to summer sipping. Made under the Craven label by Aussie–South African duo Mick and Jeanine, who met during harvest in California and eventually settled in Stellenbosch.
